# Machine Learning Projects

This is a repository for my explorations of machine learning projects I've been playing with at night since late 2024. Various technologies are used- for integration with huggingface models (or for homebrew from scratch models), Python / PyTorch are my go-to. For calling external APIs (e.g. a ChatGPT integration for example), I usually use node.

The /projects folder contains what I consider to be successful projects. /experiments contains things that didn't really work, but that I learned a fair bit from.
